        [ AMAZON INTERVIEW QUESTION ]

    Imagine there is a river which is 11 feet's wide,
    There are some stones among the river which each one is 1 foot apart from the other one,
    and extended from one side of the river to the other side.
    A frog wants to cross the river, and it can either jump 1 stone or 2 stones at a time,
    calculate how many ways are there that frog can cross the river.

    Note, it can be solved even without using recursion.
