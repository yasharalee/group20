We all will work on master branch, it's not protected branch so every collaborator can merge codes to master branch ( pull request )  without verify request.
If there was any conflict, we can easily rename our file that will fix the issue for now.
A short description of requirement as a comment inside the code will be very helpful to understand the purpose of code.
You can update this readme file at anytime.
